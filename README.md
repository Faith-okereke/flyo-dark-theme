## My process
I first did the responsiveness for desktop viw, then for the mobile.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop -first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
### What I learned
I learnt how to make responsive website and how to validate email adress using regular expressions. Hopefully, in my next project, i will make use of tailwind css.

```html
<h1>All your file...</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  flex-direction:column;
}
```
```js
const re = /\S+@\S+\.\S+/;
```
### Continued development

I want to focus on react so that i would be able to use it for for front end projects. I also want to be able to make css aniimations and live projects so i would be able to contribute to open source.

### Useful resources
- [Example resource 2](https://chat.openai.com/chat) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand regular expressions. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
